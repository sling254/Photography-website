# Photography-website
One of the greatest minds in history said that no place on earth is boring if you have had a good night’s sleep and have a pocket full of unexposed film.
Inspired by this I decided to create a website that will bring to the world’s lime light the incredible stories that pictures tell.
The photographer-website is a one-page website with three main sections that is the About us page that gives a short yet elaborate description about the website, a Gallery section   that showcase the very favorite pictures taken and finally a Contact section where you can reach out to us.
